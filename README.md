Distributed Representation Learning for Proteins: Resources and Tools
This repository contains recent as well historic researches on distributed representation learning for proteins from their Amino Acid Sequences. Learning meaning vector representation of proteins can lead to efficient drug screening as well understanding functional characteristics of proteins. Since the inception of Word2vec for distributed representation learning of proteins, there have been a surge to use similar technique to learn vector representation of proteins from their amino acid sequences. 
This repository will serve as the single-door access to tools and resources for using NLP based techniques to learn proteins representation leanring.

This repository will be regularly updated to include most recent advancement in representation learning for proteins.
